# Library project

[live demo](https://barrymoonshine.github.io/library/)

## Summary

This web app allows users to save books they have read to an online 'library' by providing the title, author, number of pages and whether they have read the book.

Users are then able to remove individual books from their library and toggle whether they have read a book or not.
